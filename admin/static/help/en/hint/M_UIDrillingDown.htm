               <P>The dbSonar's interface has been specially designed to display the relevant information for each item and allow you to dig deeper for further details in order to narrow down the reasons of a problem.</P>
               <P>Right-clicking any real-time KPI, any item in a tabular list, a trend chart or a diagrm, a context menu with options that enable you to view more information about the selected item will pop up. Each time you right-click an item and select an option from the displayed context menu of the item, a new tab will be launched to display information of the selected option. You can repeat this process on each launched tab until you see the most basic elements of an event, condition, or operation.</P>
               <P>dbSonar provides this intuitive drill-down approach through the right-click menu options to help you drill down to the heart of a performance issue.</P>
            <P>For instance, if you right-click a row in the <A href="./busySes_sh.htm">Top Busy Session</A>, a number of options related to a busy session are available. You may drill down into <A href="./gcsql_sh.htm">Active SQL in a Session</A> for viewing information of the running SQL in the session, and then drill down into <A href="./evalSQL60_new_sh.htm">SQL Evaluator</A> from  the <A href="./gcsql_sh.htm">Active SQL in a Session</A> tab for getting the execution plan and estimated cost of the SQL statement.</P>            </TD>
