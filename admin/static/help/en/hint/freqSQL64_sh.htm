					<P>This page exhibits frequently-used SQL activities<A HREF="./Glossary.htm#SQLActivity">*</A> that were executed during a specified period on a selected database/all databases. Each SQL activity is displayed with its database, cost, frequency, the number of rows returned and the brief SQL statement. This table enables you to pin-point the SQL statements that may not be properly optimized or consuming excess resources, or tables that may be poorly indexed to make the system slower in response.</P>
					<P>The time criteria for searching frequently-used SQLs is shown above the table. You can click a column head to sort the list in ascending/descending order of the selected column and click <IMG SRC="./Images/refresh.gif" ALT="Refresh Button" /> or <IMG SRC="./Images/autoRefresh.gif" ALT="Auto Refresh Button" /> anytime to refresh information on the page.</P>
