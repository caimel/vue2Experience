               <P>This page is a tool for diagnosing what SQL activities were executed in a specific period and how much cost each SQL activity<A HREF="./Glossary.htm#SQLActivity">*</A> spent. It lists SQLs that were executed within 10 minutes before and after the time of the red line shown on the <A HREF="./trendAnalysis_sh.htm">Trend Analysis</A> or any trend panel, like <A HREF="./OSCPUPanel_sh.htm">OS CPU Panel</A>. It shows related information, like cost, seqscan and frequency, of each SQL activity in ascending order of the column <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Max Cost</SPAN>.</P>
               <P>You can click a column head to sort the list in ascending/descending order of the selected column.</P>
