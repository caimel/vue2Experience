			      <P>The database server organizes memory allocations into memory pools by duration. 
			      Each memory pool is associated with a memory duration which specifies the lifetime of a memory allocated from the pool. Keeping related memory allocations in one pool helps to reduce memory fragmentation. 
			      This page presents memory statistics of each pool used in the database server. It's useful to track down memory leakage.</P>
