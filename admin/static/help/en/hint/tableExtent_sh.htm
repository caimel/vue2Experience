			      <P>Both <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Table Extent List (include system tables)</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Table Extent List (exclude system tables)</SPAN> display table/index extent information in the monitored database server<A HREF="./Glossary.htm#MDS">*</A>, but the former one includes extent information of system tables.</P>
			      <P>Each table/index is displayed with  its dbspace, database, the number of rows, the size of each row, the allocated and used size of data storage, the number of extents, whether it's a user-defined temporary table, sort file or permanent system temporary table, whether a page lock has been set for it, and its creation date.</P>
					<P>You can click a column head to sort the list in ascending/descending order of the selected column and click <IMG SRC="./Images/refresh.gif" ALT="Refresh Button" /> or <IMG SRC="./Images/autoRefresh.gif" ALT="Auto Refresh Button" /> anytime to refresh information on the page.</P>

			      <P>The number of extents and contiguity of extents are important to performance. A large number of extents or discontiguous pages of data cause the database server to spend extra time finding the data. Monitoring table/index extent will help you determine if any reorganizing or altering has to be applied to the table/index or dbspace. </P>
