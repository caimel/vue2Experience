                     <TD>As the amount of memory page out increases, CPU utilization  also increases. If  the amount of memory page out is keeping high and the size of free physical memory is small, you may need to check  if the situation is caused by any database process, oninit. If it's caused by a database process, you need to find out what SQL activities has been run (or is running) and how the resource has been taken.
