					<P>However, the database server incurs some overhead in obtaining a lock. For an operation that changes a large number of rows, obtaining one lock per row might not be cost effective. If the quantity of transactions is low but the number of lock requests is high, you may need to diagnose what kind of lock modes are used in the SQLs activities<A HREF="./Glossary.htm#SQLActivity">*</A> executed in the period of time and how these SQLs have been executed to reduce overhead of lock request.</P>
