			      <P>If a table exercises very low buffer reads, very high sequential scans, or its statistics becomes outdated frequently etc., you can get more information about how the table is designed on this page. Here, you will see columns in the table, indices created for the table, fragments in it, access privileges granted on it and references of the table.</P>
			      <P>Not only the SQL optimization but also the table schema design will impact the SQL performance. According to information exhibited here, you may consider redesigning/modifying the table schema, fragmenting tables or eliminating table fragments in order to  optimize tables for parallel access. </P>
