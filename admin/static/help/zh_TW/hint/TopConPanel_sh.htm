               <P>This page gives you an overview of what sessions use much more CPU resources, have heavy disk I/O activities and consume lots of memory. Monitoring information in these lists that are refreshed every couple of seconds automatically, you can identify which session have heavy CPU, disk I/O and memory loading and drill down the session to find out the root cause.</P>
               <P>The <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Top Busy Sessions</SPAN> shows information of active top busy sessions running in the database server. They are listed in descending order of the  <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">[OP+]</SPAN> column. <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">[OP+]</SPAN> column, the incremental operations  like read/write and networking etc., and <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">[SEQ+]</SPAN> column, the incremental sequential scans,  are the number of activities exercised by a session in a refreshing interval. Each session is displayed with   how long it has been alive, how many operations have been executed up to now or in a refreshing interval, how many sequential scans have been exercised up to now or in a refreshing interval, and what the database is being accessed etc. Please refer to <A HREF="./busySes_sh.htm">Top Busy Sessions</A> for more information of symptoms and approaches found in the tabular list.</P>
               <P>The <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Top I/O Sessions</SPAN> shows information of active sessions in the database server with extremenly busy I/O activities.  They are listed in descending order of the <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">[RW+]</SPAN> column. <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">[RW+]</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">[DskW+]</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">[DskR+]</SPAN> columns are the incremental number of disk reads/writes activities exercised by a session in a refreshing interval. Each session is displayed with how long it has been alive, how many reads/writes have been exercised up to now or in a refreshing interval, and what the database is been accessed etc. Please refer to <A HREF="./busyDskIOSes_sh.htm">Top I/O Sessions</A> for more information of symptoms and approaches found in the tabular list.</P>
               <P>The <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Top Memory Sessions</SPAN> shows information of active sessions in the database server that consume the most memory. They are listed in descending order of the <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">[Mem Allocated]</SPAN> column. Each session is displayed with how long it has been alive, how many memory have been allocated and used, how many locks are held by the session, how files are opened in a session, and how many buffer reads/writes have been exercised up to now etc. Please refer to <A HREF="./topMemSes_sh.htm">Top Memory Sessions</A> for more information of symptoms and approaches found in the tabular list.</P>
