				   <P>This page displays a comprehensive report of the entire database system operated in the specified period of time. This report provides graphical trend charts of OS and database characteristics, tabulated high-frequency or
cost-intensive SQL statements, incomplete and/or outdated table statistics, and expert tuning guidelines based on an in-depth analysis of the database system. And the performance report offers advice and suggestions about using the UPDATE STATISTICS command, optimizing the database design for speed, and improving the operating system and CPU performance. This
report makes your job as a database administrator much easier, as you no longer have to spend huge amounts of time obtaining diagnostic information from the databases and you can use the suggestions offered by the report to instantly streamline the performance of the system.</P>

 					         <P>The Informix query optimizer depends on the system catalog tables to decide the SQL execution path.  Thus, if the system catalog data is out-of-date, the optimizer may generate incorrect and inefficient execution paths.</P>
					         <P>In such a scenario, you need to locate database tables that have outdated statistics and are involved in a majority of database activity. Then, you can run the UPDATE STATISTICS command for these tables to improve performance.</P>
							 <P> The database can obtain benefit from running the UPDATE STATISTICS command on these tables that have low or zero value of <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">NRows in Update Statistics</SPAN>  and big value of  <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Accurated NRows</SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Tables with Outdated UPDATE STATISTICS Information</SPAN>, and are the top busiest in <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">Tables with Outdated UPDATE STATISTICS Information</SPAN>.</P>

 					         <P>The database server depends on indexes for table columns to access data from large tables. If a column does not have an index specified, the server uses basic sequential scanning to access table data. This technique can be really costly for the server to access very large database tables that have a very low hit rate for restricted query criteria. Using an index for frequently accessed data columns is thus an effective data retrieval technique.</P>
					         <P>In such a scenario, you need to identify SQL statements that are used frequently in <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">SQL Statements with High Cost</SPAN> and have high cost in <SPAN CLASS="HL_Key">SQL Statements with High Frequency</SPAN>, and then create indexes for the columns that are being frequently accessed.</P>
